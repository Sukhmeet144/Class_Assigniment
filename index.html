      <br>  Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which,through casual or organised participation,
       aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases,
       entertainment for spectators. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of
        simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete,
        simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other.
        Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser.
        Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a
         regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.

     <img  src="sports3.jpg" align="right" height="500" width="50%" ><br><br>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity,
     with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition,
     and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical
      element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim
      recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge
       as bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical
        sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be
         admitted as sports.</p>
